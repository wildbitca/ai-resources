# Gentleman-Skills

> Community-driven AI agent skills for Claude Code, OpenCode, and other AI assistants.

Skills are specialized instruction sets that teach AI assistants how to work with specific frameworks, libraries, and patterns. They provide on-demand context so the AI writes code following best practices and conventions.

## Philosophy

- **Curated Skills** - Personally crafted and battle-tested by [@Gentleman-Programming](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming). These reflect MY way of thinking about code architecture - Scope Rule, file naming conventions, signals-first approach, and more. Some skills (like testing and Python) have been developed in collaboration with the team at [Prowler](https://github.com/prowler-cloud).

- **Community Skills** - Created by the community, for the community. These go through a democratic voting process before being accepted.

## Curated Skills

These skills represent patterns and practices I've personally tested and refined over years of development.

## Installation

### For Claude Code / OpenCode

Copy the skills you want to use to your Claude configuration:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/Gentleman-Skills.git

# Copy curated skills to Claude config
cp -r Gentleman-Skills/curated/* ~/.claude/skills/

# Or copy specific skills
cp -r Gentleman-Skills/curated/react-19 ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r Gentleman-Skills/curated/typescript ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Manual Installation

1. Create the skills directory if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
   ```

2. Copy the skill folder(s) you want:
   ```bash
   cp -r curated/react-19 ~/.claude/skills/
   ```

3. Reference the skill in your project's `CLAUDE.md` or global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:
   ```markdown
   ## Skills
   When working with React, read `~/.claude/skills/react-19/SKILL.md` first.
   ```

## How Skills Work

Each skill contains a `SKILL.md` file with:

1. **Trigger conditions** - When the AI should load this skill
2. **Patterns and rules** - Specific coding conventions to follow
3. **Code examples** - Reference implementations
4. **Anti-patterns** - What to avoid

When the AI detects a matching context (e.g., editing a React component), it reads the skill file and applies those patterns to its responses.

## Contributing

We welcome community contributions! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full process.

> **Pro tip**: Load the [github-pr](curated/github-pr) skill to create PRs that follow our conventions!

### Quick Overview

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Create** your skill following the [skill template](SKILL_TEMPLATE.md)
3. **Submit** a Pull Request to the `community/` folder using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
4. **Community votes** for 7 days using reactions
5. **Accepted** if more positive than negative votes

### Voting System
