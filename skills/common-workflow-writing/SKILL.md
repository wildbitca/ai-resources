# Workflow Writing Standard

## **Priority: P0 (CRITICAL)**

## Core Rules

- **Templates, not examples**: Workflows define _structure_, not pre-filled data. The agent generates data at runtime.
- **No example rows in tables**: Include headers + 1 skeleton row only. Never populate with fake data.
- **No prose explanations**: If a bullet or command achieves the same result, delete the paragraph.
- **No pre-answered questions**: Don't document what the agent _will_ output — let it output it.
- **Merge sequential steps**: If two steps always happen together, they are one step.

## Size Limits

| File type         | Limit     | If exceeded                       |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Workflow `.md`    | 80 lines  | Extract detail to `references/`   |
| SKILL.md          | 100 lines | Extract examples to `references/` |
| Table rows        | 8         | Extract to `references/`          |
| Inline code block | 10 lines  | Extract to `references/`          |

## Workflow Structure (Required order)

```
1. Goal (1 sentence)
2. Steps (imperative verb → command or checklist)
3. Output template (headers only, no pre-filled rows)
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **No verbose step preambles**: `"Before we start, it's important to understand..."` → Delete
- **No pre-filled report rows**: `| Security | P0 | ✅ PASS | CLIENT_ID moved to env |` → Delete
- **No repeated examples**: Same concept shown twice in different formats → Keep one
- **No "How to do X" sections**: The step IS the instruction
- **No caution blocks for obvious rules**: Reserve `> ⚠️` for genuinely non-obvious risks

## Quick Self-Check Before Saving

- [ ] Can the agent reconstruct any removed content at runtime from context? If yes → remove it
- [ ] Is every table row real structure, not example data?
- [ ] Are there any paragraphs a bullet list could replace?
- [ ] Would cutting this in half still give the agent enough to act on?
