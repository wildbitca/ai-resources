# Mobile Security

## **Priority: P0 (CRITICAL)**

Standards for basic mobile security and PII protection.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Secure Storage**: Use `flutter_secure_storage` for tokens/PII. Never use `shared_preferences`.
- **Hardcoding**: Never store API keys or secrets in Dart code. Use `--dart-define` or `.env`.
- **Obfuscation**: Always release with `--obfuscate` and `--split-debug-info`. Note: This is a deterrent, not cryptographic protection. For sensitive logic, move to backend.
- **SSL Pinning**: For high-security apps, use `dio_certificate_pinning`.
- **Root Detection**: Use `flutter_jailbreak_detection` for financial/sensitive applications.
- **PII Masking**: Mask sensitive data (email, phone) in logs and analytics.
