# Layer-Based Clean Architecture

## **Priority: P0 (CRITICAL)**

Standardized separation of concerns and dependency flow using DDD principles.

## Structure

```text
lib/
├── domain/ # Pure Dart: entities (@freezed), failures, repository interfaces
├── infrastructure/ # Implementation: DTOs, data sources, mappers, repo impls
├── application/ # Orchestration: BLoCs / Cubits
└── presentation/ # UI: Screens, reusable components
```

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Dependency Flow**: `Presentation -> Application -> Domain <- Infrastructure`. Dependencies point inward.
- **Pure Domain**: No Flutter (Material/Store) or Infrastructure (Dio/Hive) dependencies in `Domain`.
- **Functional Error Handling**: Repositories must return `Either<Failure, Success>`.
- **Always Map**: Infrastructure must map DTOs to Domain Entities; do not leak DTOs to UI.
- **Immutability**: Use `@freezed` for all entities and failures.
- **Logic Placement**: No business logic in UI; widgets only display state and emit events.
- **Inversion of Control**: Use `get_it` to inject repository implementations into BLoCs.

## Anti-Patterns

- **No DTOs in UI**: Never import a `.g.dart` or Data class directly in a Widget.
- **No Material in Domain**: Do not import `package:flutter/material.dart` in the `domain` layer.
- **No Shared Prefs in Repo**: Do not use `shared_preferences` directly in a Repository; use a Data Source.
